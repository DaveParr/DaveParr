## About

This profile is generated from new data each hour. GitHub Actions drive it, by triggering a job which calls the API, and produces a graph of every repo I am the source for which has a fork, star or watch. Another job uses my package, [`dev.to.ol`](https://github.com/DaveParr/dev.to.ol) to query my posts, and selects the top 5 by reaction to show in a table with links. If you want to understand more about how this works, have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/DaveParr/DaveParr).
